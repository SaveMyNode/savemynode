# Security Policy

## Introduction
The security policy outlines the security measures and practices for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the project. The goal is to protect the project's code, data, and users from potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities in the project, please report them immediately to the project maintainers at [sid9.karanam@gmail.com]. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.

## Security Best Practices
1. **Code Reviews**: All code changes must undergo peer review to ensure they adhere to security best practices.
2. **Dependency Management**: Keep all dependencies up-to-date and monitor for security vulnerabilities.
3. **Access Control**: Limit access to the project's codebase and infrastructure to authorized personnel only.
4. **Data Protection**: Ensure sensitive data, such as user information, is encrypted and handled securely.
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Patch Management
Apply security patches and updates to the project's dependencies and infrastructure promptly to minimize exposure to known vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response
In the event of a security breach or incident, follow these steps:
1. **Containment**: Limit the impact of the breach by isolating affected systems.
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the extent of the breach and identify compromised data or systems.
3. **Communication**: Notify affected parties and stakeholders about the breach and provide guidance on next steps.
4. **Resolution**: Address the root cause of the breach and implement measures to prevent future incidents.
5. **Documentation**: Document the incident, response actions, and lessons learned for future reference.
